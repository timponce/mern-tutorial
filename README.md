## Project Summary

This web app allows a user to register and login and logout with unique credentials (email and password) to a dashboard where they can set, view, and delete goals.

This project was made while coding alongside Travery Media's [Learn the Mern Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0exw-9YJBo&list=PLillGF-RfqbbQeVSccR9PGKHzPJSWqcsm) tutorial to get a better understanding of implementing a MERN stack application from start to finish.


## Project Details

### I learned the following from this project:
1. The basics of the MERN STACK
   - Setting up the backend of my application using NodeJS with Express to read and write data from a MongoDB collection.
   - Creating models for my data
   - Configuring controllers to handle requests to manipulate data
   - Using React and Redux to display a user interface to interact with the backend
 2. Introduction to authorization and user data encryption using JSON Web Tokens and bcrypt

### I would like to learn more about:
1. Managing state in Redux as this was my first introduction to using it
2. Salting and hashing passwords

### I used the following technologies to complete my app:
- Redux - JavaScript library
- React - JavaScript library
- JWT - password encryption
- bcrypt - password hashing
- Node.js - javascript runtime
- Express - web application framwork
- MongoDB - NoSQL databse
- Heroku - cloud platform as a service
- Git - version control system
